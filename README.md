:construction: At the moment, Portfolio is at a very early stage of development and is not suitable for practical use.

## Development

To start Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
